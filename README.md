# Game-Of-Life
Game of Life with Saad and Jafar.

## Introduction
This was a 5day-week deep dive where we had to build Conway's Game of Life assigned by our school as a project. 
In this project we had no idea from where to start. So after a day of doing research.

## Day 1
We had no idea where to start. 
So what we later started doing was looking up information from coding repos, YouTube videos and the rules for this project.

## Day 2
In this day we made an table. With the basic logic implemented to let the game play on its own. So we removed that part of the logic to let it be cleared out when run. That was most for that day.

## Day 3
