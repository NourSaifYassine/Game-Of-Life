# Game-Of-Life
Game of Life with Saad and Jafar.

## Introduction
This was a 5day-week deep dive where we had to build Conway's Game of Life assigned by our school as a project. 
In this project we had no idea from where to start. So after a day of doing research we had collected enough information to work on our project.

## Day 1
We had no idea where to start. 
So what we later started doing was looking up information from coding repos, YouTube videos and the rules for this project.

## Day 2
In this day we made a HTML table. With the basic logic implemented to let the game play on its own. So we removed that part of the logic to let it be cleared out when run. That was most for that day.

## Day 3
On Day 3 we worked on the styling to make our project look more attractive.
We went to some other student groups of the same project and we asked for some advice.
After some suggestions we decided we wanted to build alphabetic letters as a mousemove-key-input.

## Day 4
In this day we succesvolle added the alphabetic letters into the HTML table.
We additionally added the Color Picker for all Cells in the HTML table.

## Day 5
Day 5 incoming...

## How to use
Steps:
    1. You clone the repo
    2. You copy the PATH to the index.html.
    3. You paste the url in the webbrowser.

## Guide
Features:
    1.1 When hovering on a specifc table cell, a certain letter could be pressed.
    1.2 After the letter is pressed it takes the right array associated with and generates the letterKey with the associated.
    1.3. Capable of locating the mouse inside the table location
    2. Change colors all cells in the HTML table.
    3. Capable changing the background-color.
    4. Capable randomizing all cells in the HTML table.
    5. Capable of clearing the screen.
    6. Capable of playing the game by the rules.

## Rules
Rules: 
    1. If one cell has 2-3 living neighbourcells then it will stay alive and dead otherwise so it then is non-existent.
    2. If a dead cell with 3 other cells are alive then another comes back to life otherwise it stays dead.
